# landing-page-imitation

An Odin project attempting to imitate a landing page based on a png and limited style hints

The landing page can be previewed [here](https://vwainman.github.io/landing-page-imitation/).
I've gone one step further than the project requirements to work within smaller screen sizes (i.e. mobile).

The page should look and feel like below:
