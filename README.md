# landing-page-imitation

An Odin project attempting to imitate a landing page based on a png and limited style hints, which can be viewed in the references directory.

The landing page can be previewed [here](https://vwainman.github.io/landing-page-imitation/).
I've gone one step further than the project specifications to fit the design within mobile screen sizes (by flexing certain containers into columns under a certain page width).

The page should look and feel like the image below:
